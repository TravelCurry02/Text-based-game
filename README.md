# Overview

This project is a text-based adventure game built in C#. It allows players to explore a fictional world, interact with rooms, encounter events, and track their progress. As a software engineer, this project demonstrates my understanding of C# fundamentals, including object-oriented programming, file management, and gameplay mechanics.

The purpose of this software is to create an interactive and educational experience while showcasing the use of data structures, file operations, and event-driven programming in C#. Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of the language's syntax and expand my ability to design modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

# Development Environment

- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022
- **Programming Language**: C# 11
- **Tools and Libraries**:
  - System.IO for file operations
  - System.Text.Json for serialization and deserialization
  - Custom namespaces and classes for modular development
